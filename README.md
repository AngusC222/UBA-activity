> A script that creates a line graph of activity in the UBA server

## How does this work?

1. The discord.py file will pull all the messages from the #activity channel
2. The JSON is then broken down until it is just time stamps and the reaction count
3. The reactions and time stamps are then put into a line graph with reactions as the Y axis and time stamp as the X axis
4. the graph is then exported to the graph.png file

## Example:
